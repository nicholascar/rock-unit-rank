    dcterms:description "The rock-unit-rank classification provisionally offered here draws variously and with difficulty from several international stratigraphic codes/guides, to best, albeit not fully, adhere to the present nomenclatural, rock-rank usage in Queensland and Australia. However, this work has variously highlighted the inappropriateness and/or deficiencies of some usage, with the aim of the approach presented here to provide a basis for initial discussion and, ultimately, a path to a more-refined, locally-employed rock-unit-rank classification, based on evolving international standards and proposals, to better satisfy the needs and demands of the digital/information age. The principal issue relates to highly metamorphosed rocks of unknown origin [‘where rocks have been modified to the extent that the original unit category … and/or the nature of the relationship with adjacent units … cannot be deduced or inferred reliably (Gillespie & Leslie, 2021, p. 8)]. Such problems have been highlighted and variously dealt with across the codes, guides and classifications referred to. But, in addressing these difficulties, Gillespie & Leslie (2021, p. 8, figure 2), in their new system for classifying mappable rock units in the UK (BRUCS: the British Geological Survey’s Rock Unit Classification System), presented the new class ‘Tectonometamorphic Units’ for ‘rock bodies that cannot reliably be classified as an accumulated unit (either a stratiform/layered-sedimentary or extrusive-igneous-rock unit) or an intrusion as a result of superimposed deformation and/or metamorphism’. They recognized six ranks in this class (e.g., Ranks 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively: Superassemblage, Assemblage, Subassemblage, Ophiolite/Package/Set), but their attendant terminology almost has no present application to Australian rock ranks/types of such nature (apart from Ophiolite), soliciting a need for review and potential change. Accordingly, for these rock types, specifically highly-metamorphosed rocks, the status quo in Queensland (and Australia) is unavoidably adhered to, presently retaining such rocks as lithostratigraphic units [e.g., Sulieman Gneiss, ASUD* 24510; Plum Mountain Gneiss, ASUD* 24459; Yambo Metamorphic Group (high-grade metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks), ASUD* 23282; and, of lower metamorphic grade, the structurally-simpler Holroyd Group (metasiltstone/sandstone, slate, phyllite, quartzite, schist, gneiss, metadolerite, amphibolite), ASUD* 25063 (all referred to, e.g., in Jell, 2013: Geology of Queensland, Geological Survey of Queensland, 1063 pages). But, both the latter two units, because of the mixed-genetic rock classes within them, would be more appropriately ranked as complex rock units (than as lithostratigraphic units). Otherwise proposed here is a closely-considered selection, mixture, and, in part, an extension/variation of rank terms variously from: [1] The International Stratigraphic Guide/ISG (Salvador, 1987; Murphy & Salvador, 1999; Salvador, 2013; ISG online, accessed 04.11.2021): for lithostratigraphic units embracing: (a) layered/stratiform, accumulated sedimentary rocks, (b) stratified volcanic rocks, and (c) bodies of metamorphic rocks that can be recognised as of sedimentary and/or extrusive volcanic origin. [2] Gillespie & Leslie (2021) for the BRUCS’s classification of intrusive igneous rocks (Ranks 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively: Supersuite, Suite, Subsuite, Centre/Cluster), but here differing in proposing ‘intrusion’ (igneous intrusion) as Rank 5 and as the basic rank unit of intrusive igneous rock types that is the equivalent of ‘formation’ in lithostratigraphic-rank nomenclature (although ‘equivalent’ ranking levels do not align here, with ‘formation’ sitting against centre/cluster at Rank 4 in BRUCS). Below the hierarchial level of ‘intrusion’ other unit types are not here further ranked: they include lopolith, pluton, ring-intrusion, and swarm (assigned to Rank 5 in BRUCS) and cone-sheet, diatreme, dyke, laccolith, neck, pipe, plug, etc. (assigned to Rank 6 in BRUCS; see and compare Gillespie & Leslie, 2021). [3] Scandinavian geological-nomenclatural guides for tectonostratigraphic units (tectonically-displaced, allochthonous sheets: nappes or nappe complexes), largely the guide for Sweden by Kumpulainen (2017), but also see: Nystuen (1989) for the Norwegian guide and Strand et al. (2010) for the Finnish guide). These rock units are essentially tectonometamorphic units sensu Gillespie & Leslie (2021, pp. 8, 16), but, seizing their suggestion, that, ‘in parts of the world … it may be appropriate … to use a hierarchy of tectonostratigraphic units (following the guidance used in Norway, Finland or Sweden)’, they are treated as stand-alone tectonic units. [4] The proposal of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy to apply rank to complex rock units (complex, supercomplex), but here recognising complex rock units as a distinct class of rock units (neither as lithodemic units, as per the Subccommission and the North American Stratigraphic Code, nor as lithostratigraphic units, as per the ISG), but largely following Gillespie & Leslie for ‘mixed-class units’, albeit differing from them in the local nomenclatural constraint of necessitating the present need to follow the ISG definition of a ‘Complex’ [a unit composed of diverse types of any class or classes or rocks (sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic), as opposed to a complex embracing a mixture of two or more genetic classes of rocks, i.e., igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, as per the North American Stratigrphic Code (2005) and Kulpmainen (2017), etc.]. ASUD* = Australian Stratigraphic Units Database Stratigraphic Number."@en ; 
    skos:editorialNote """Following Gillespie & Leslie (2017), the North American Stratigraphic Code (2005 ) lithodemic classification/nomenclature (supersuite, suite and lithodeme) for nonstratiform, ranked units of ‘intrusive, highly deformed and/or highly metamorphosed rock’; and for nonstratiform unranked complex units (a mixture of rocks of two or more genetic classes) is not followed, but only from the perspectives: (1) the terms ‘lithodeme’ and ‘lithodemic’ are not utilized; (2) the ‘subsuite’, ‘suite’ and ‘supersuite’ rankings are applied only to intrusive rock units, not also highly metamorphosed rock units (as per Gillespie & Leslie, 2021); and complex rock units are treated separately and given rankings (after Gillespie & Leslie, 2021). Lithodemic nomenclature, which included rock complexes, was further advocated in the various Scandinavian nomenclatural guides (e.g., Kumpulainen, 2017); also compare the ISG (Online, accessed 28.09.2021) for the little-followed recommendation: ‘use of the term "suite" seems inadvisable’. The ‘suite’ terminology is entrenched in not only in Queensland/Australian rock nomenclature, but also that of elsewhere."""@en ;

Here, below the hierarchial level of ‘intrusion’, specific intrusive unit types are not further ranked; they include lopolith, pluton, ring-intrusion, and swarm (assigned to Rank 5 in BRUCS) and cone-sheet, diatreme, dyke, laccolith, neck, pipe, plug, ring-dyke, sheet, sill, etc. (assigned to Rank 6 in BRUCS) [Gillespie & Leslie, 2021].

Contrastingly, here, the term ‘intrusion’ is taken, at a generic level, to represent any intrusion that may or may not be further classified by another more definitive term (at lower levels of rank that, as stated, are not here delineated, as some of these terms can be concatenated, e.g., dyke-and-sill-swarm; see Gillespie & Leslie, 2021)."""@en ;

The North American Stratigraphic Code (2005) and Kumpulainen (2017), together with other Scandinavian guides, preferably adhere to a more specific definition, restricting a complex to a mixture of two or more genetic classes, albeit regarding a complex as a non-ranked lithodemic unit (generally, a defined, nonstratiform/non-stratified body of predominantly intrusive or highly deformed and/or highly metamorphosed rock). However, as the ISG usage (in embracing a mixture of diverse types of any genetic class) better suits the nomenclature applied to some complex rock units in Queensland, it is therefore provisionally followed. A complex, although unranked in the North American Stratigraphic Code, was considered to be ‘commonly comparable to suite or supersuite’, such that two or more associated complexes could be grouped in a supersuite. This problematical application of lithodemic nomenclature was addressed by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy with their suggested introduction of the term ‘supercomplex’ and attendant recommendation for a two-fold hierarchy of rank for lithodemic rock units: lithodeme, suite and supersuite; and complex and supercomplex. Here, complex rock units are separated from lithostratigraphic and other single-class units (e.g., intrusive rock units) and broadly treated as stand-alone, largely nonstratiform, mixed-class units, thus reflecting the approach of Gillespie & Leslie (2021) in their construction of the British Geological Survey’s rock classification system (BRUCS). [Also, following Gillespie & Leslie, the North American Stratigraphic Code lithodemic terminology is not followed, and ‘suite’ rankings are applied solely to intrusive rock units (not also to metamorphic units)]. However, as indicated, nomenclatural usage in Queensland is not true to the more restricted and preferred definition of rock complexes comprising more than one genetic class of rocks (e.g., Jell, 2013)."""@en ;
